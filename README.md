# Universal Workflow Automation Platform

A primitive-based workflow automation system using Claude agent swarms to eliminate backlogs for any organization.

## Core Concept
1. **Data Collection**: Claude agents gather workflow data (web scraping, APIs, files)
2. **Processing**: Swarm processes backlogs in parallel 
3. **Validation**: Multi-agent consensus on recommendations
4. **Reporting**: Partial reports (teaser) + complete reports (on payment)

## First Implementation
- Target: Lackawanna County property tax appeals
- Data Source: Online assessment database + appeals information
- Value Prop: Process 8-month backlog in 2 weeks, deliver before payment

## Usage
```bash
# Start Claude Code session
claude

# Tell Claude Code:
"Build the universal workflow platform. Start with Lackawanna County 
property tax appeals. Use web scraping to gather data, Claude Flow 
swarms to process appeals, and generate partial/complete reports."
```

## Architecture
- 95% Claude agents, 5% human oversight
- Claude Flow for swarm coordination
- Self-evolving primitives
- Built-in observability
